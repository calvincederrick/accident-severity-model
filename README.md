Road Accident Severity Prediction Model
Overview
This project aims to build a linear regression model to predict the severity of road accidents based on various influencing factors. The model utilizes a dataset containing features such as time, day of the week, driver demographics, and other relevant variables to assess accident severity.

Dataset
The dataset used for this project includes various features that affect road accident severity. The key columns in the dataset are:

Time: The time of the accident.
Day_of_week: The day of the week when the accident occurred.
Age_band_of_driver: Age range of the driver involved in the accident.
Sex_of_driver: Gender of the driver.
Accident_severity: The target variable representing the severity of the accident.
Please ensure that you replace the placeholder in the code (your_dataset.csv) with the actual path to your dataset.

Installation
Clone the repository to your local machine:

Install the required libraries:

pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn joblib
Usage
Load the dataset by providing the correct path in the code.
Run the accident_severity_model.py file to train the model and make predictions.
The trained model will be saved as accident_severity_model.pkl.
Example of Predicting Accident Severity
You can predict accident severity for a new set of independent variables using the following example data format:


example_data = np.array([[15, 2, 1, 1, 2, 3, 2, 1, 1, 4, 0, 3, 1, 1, 0, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 2, 1, 1, 0]]).reshape(1, -1)
Model Evaluation
The model is evaluated using Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared metrics. Lower MSE and higher R-squared values indicate better model performance.

Future Improvements
Implement more sophisticated feature selection techniques.
Explore other machine learning models for better accuracy.
Include additional features that may influence accident severity.
